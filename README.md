# My Java Learning Journey: From Console Projects to SpringBoot and Docker

This document outlines my journey of learning Java, a versatile language widely used in web application development. It is a compilation of various projects that I undertook, ranging from simple console applications to complex SpringBoot projects and even containerized applications using Docker.

## Console Projects
My journey began with console projects, which are the simplest form of Java applications. These projects helped me understand the basics of Java, such as variables, data types, control structures, loops, and functions. I built various console applications like calculators, text-based games, and simple management systems.

## SpringBoot Projects
Once I was comfortable with the basics, I moved on to SpringBoot projects. SpringBoot is a framework that simplifies the setup of Spring applications. I used it to build various web applications with complex functionalities. These projects helped me understand concepts like dependency injection, REST APIs, security, and database integration.

## Docker Projects
The final stage of my journey involved Docker, a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. I learned how to containerize my SpringBoot applications and manage them using Docker. This gave me a solid understanding of containerization and its benefits, such as consistency across multiple environments and ease of deployment.

## Conclusion
This compilation of projects reflects my dedication and effort in mastering Java. It showcases my progression from a beginner understanding the basics through console projects, to gaining a deep understanding of web application development with SpringBoot, and finally to deploying applications using Docker. I believe the knowledge and experience I gained from this journey will be invaluable in any future projects or roles involving Java.
